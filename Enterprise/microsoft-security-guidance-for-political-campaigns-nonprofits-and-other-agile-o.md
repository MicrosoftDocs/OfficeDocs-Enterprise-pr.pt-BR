This solution demonstrates how to quickly build an environment with essential cloud services that include secure controls from the start. This guidance includes prescriptive security recommendations for protecting data, identities, email, and access from mobile devices.

To create a dev/test environment for this solution, use the following test lab guides: 
  
- [Configure groups and users for a political campaign dev/test environment](configure-groups-and-users-for-a-political-campaign-dev-test-environment.md)
    
     Create trial subscriptions for Office 365 and EMS and then create groups and users for a representative political campaign.
    
- [Create team sites in a political campaign dev/test environment](create-team-sites-in-a-political-campaign-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Create four SharePoint Online team sites with Internal, Private, Sensitive, and Highly Confidential levels of security.
    
For additional security features for demonstration or proof of concept, see [Office 365 Test Lab Guides](http://aka.ms/o365tlgs).
